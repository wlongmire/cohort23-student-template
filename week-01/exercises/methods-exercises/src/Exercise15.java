    /* FIZZ BUZZ

    Historically, the Fizz Buzz (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) problem was used in programming interviews.
    Not sure if it still is. Just in case, we'll get it out of the way in Milestone 1.

    Write a program to:
    - Prompt a user for a positive integer and store the result. (Could reuse a readInt method.)
    - Loop from the number 1 to the user's integer.
    - If the number is divisible by 3, print Fizz.
    - If the number is divisible by 5, print Buzz.
    - If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print Fizz Buzz.
    - If the number is not divisible by either 3 or 5, print the number.
