/**
 * The most powerful chess piece.
 * Moves horizontally, vertically, or diagonally as many spaces as she wants.
 * She tracks her current position with two integer fields: row and column.
 * Rows and columns are zero-based.
 * The queen starts at row 0 and column 0, though there is no board.
 * Row 7 - - - - - - - -
 * Row 6 - - - - - - - -
 * Row 5 - - - - - - - -
 * Row 4 - - - - - - - -
 * Row 3 - - - - - - - -
 * Row 2 - - - - - - - -
 * Row 1 - - - - - - - -
 * Row 0 Q - - - - - - -
 * Cols: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
