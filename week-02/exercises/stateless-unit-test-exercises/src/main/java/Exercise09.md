1. Create a new Maven project. You may want to open this file with a different editor so IntelliJ can do its thing.
2. Add the latest version of JUnit 5 as a Maven dependency.
3. Add a class named `ArrayMethods`.
4. Add a method:
    ```
    Name: removeZero
    Inputs: int[]
    Output: int[]
    Description: Finds all non-zero elements and copies them to a new array. 
    Don't over allocated.
    You'll need to count non-zeros first.
    ```
5. Create tests for removeZero and confirm it is correct.
